2 PCB vertical traces for dielectrics test

* .units specifies the units of all the numbers used in the file
.units m

* A .default line (optional) can specify defaults for any parameter. 
* List of parameters:
* w 	 is the width of the segments
* h 	 is the height of the segments
* fnw	 is the number of filaments per segment width
* fnh	 is the number of filaments per segment height
* frw	 is the incremental ratio for filaments along the segment width
* frh	 is the incremental ratio for filaments along the segment height
* nl	 is the number of sections per segment
* pnw	 is the number of panels per segment along the width
* pnh	 is the number of panels per segment along the height
* pfracw is the incremental ratio for panels along the segment width
* pfrach is the incremental ratio for panels along the segment height
* pfracl is the incremental ratio for panels along the segment length
* a line can be continued on the next line using a + at the beginning
