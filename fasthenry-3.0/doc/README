Print the three files:  manual_001.ps, manual_002.ps, and manual_003.ps
  to get the complete manual.  

The LaTex files are provided for a text version of the manual but
the associated figures are not included so LaTex will fail on these files.

For the documentation on nonuniformly discretized planes, print the two parts
nonuniform_manual_1.ps
nonuniform_manual_2.ps
