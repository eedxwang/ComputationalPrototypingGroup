\newcommand{\sqdconvcap}{The GMRES residual norms for the linear system
solution corresponding to the Diaphragm problem (Figure~\protect\ref{sqd})
with the top conductor at unit potential. As is evident here, the AMA
method generally makes the iterate calculation more efficient, while
the PAMA algorithm leads to fewer iterations.}
