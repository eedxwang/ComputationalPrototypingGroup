\section{Experimental Results}
\label{expres}

In this section, results from computational experiments are presented
to demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the
preconditioned, adaptive, multipole-accelerated (PAMA) 3-D capacitance
extraction algorithm described above.  In particular, the program
FASTCAP, which can use both direct factorization and
multipole-accelerated techniques, has been developed and incorporated
into MIT's MEMCAD (Micro-Electrical-Mechanical Computer-Aided Design)
system \cite{maseeh90}.  The structures described below were created
with the solid modeling program in the MEMCAD system, PATRAN, or by
computer program, and all capacitance calculations were performed
using FASTCAP.  The multipole-accelerated algorithms in FASTCAP use,
by default, second-order multipole expansions and a GMRES convergence
tolerance (see Algorithm 1) of $ 0.01 $.

\input{mtt-sphere2}

\input{mtt-cuben5}

To demonstrate absolute accuracy, the FASTCAP program was used to
compute the capacitance of a unit sphere, discretized as in
Figure~\ref{sphere2}, and a unit cube, discretized as in
Figure~\ref{cuben5}.  In Table~\ref{simpres}, the capacitances
computed using the PAMA algorithm are compared with the capacitances
computed using direct factorization of $ P $ in (\ref{eq:qtop}) (Direct),
and with analytic results for the unit sphere and with reference results
for the unit cube.  As can be seen from the table, the results using
the PAMA algorithm are easily within one percent of the analytic or
reference results.

\input{mtt-weave}

The PAMA algorithm is nearly as accurate as the direct factorization
method even on more complex problems, such as the $ 2 \times 2$ woven bus
structure in Figure~\ref{weave}.  The capacitances computed using the
two methods are compared in Table~\ref{weavres}, using coarse, medium,
and fine discretizations of the woven bus structure, also shown in
Figure~\ref{weave}.  Note that the coupling capacitance $C_{12}$
between conductors one and two, which is forty-times smaller than the
self-capacitance $ C_{11} $, is computed nearly as accurately with the PAMA
algorithm as with direct factorization.

\input{mtt-growth}

The computational cost of using the FASTCAP program is roughly
proportional to the product of the number of conductors, $ m $, and
the number of panels $ n $.  This is experimentally verified using a
parameterized version of the woven bus structure in
Figure~\ref{weave}, that is, the structure is extented to make a $ 3
\times 3 $ bus, a $ 4 \times 4 $ bus and a $ 5 \times 5 $ bus, with
surfaces discretized as depicted in the $Woven1 $ example of
Figure~\ref{weave}. In Figure~\ref{growth}, the CPU times for
computing the capacitances of the woven bus structures are plotted as
a function of $ mn $, and as the graph clearly demonstrates the
computation time does grow linearly.

\input{mtt-via}

\input{mtt-sqd}

To demonstrate the effectiveness of various aspects of the PAMA
algorithm on a range of problems, in Table~\ref{main} the CPU times
required to compute the capacitances of six different examples using
four different methods are given.  The examples Cube2 and Sphere2
are finer discretizations of the unit cube and sphere in
Figures~\ref{sphere2} and \ref{cuben5}; the examples 2 $ \times $ 2
Woven Bus and 5 $ \times $ 5  Woven Bus are described
above; the example Via, shown in Figure~\ref{exam}, models a
pair of connections between integrated circuit pins and a
chip-carrier; and the example Diaphragm, shown in
Figure~\ref{sqd}, is a model for a microsensor \cite{johnso91}.

From Table~\ref{main}, it can be seen that using the adaptive
multipole algorithm (AMA) typically reduces the computation time by a factor
of two over using the multipole algorithm (MA) alone, and that using the
preconditioner can reduce the computation time as much as a factor of
three.  Also, note that the PAMA algorithm is more than two
orders of magnitude faster than direct methods for the larger
problems.

\input{mtt-sqdconv}

The reduction in execution time afforded by the adaptive algorithm
is due to increased efficiency in calculating each iterative loop iteration,
rather than in a reduction the total number of iterations.
The convergence 
plot in Figure~\ref{sqdconv} correspond to
one of the linear system solutions associated with the Diaphragm problem and
is representative of the general case.
As is evident in the figure, the AMA algorithm generally computes
nearly identical iterates to those calculated by the MA method but is faster,
as reported in Table~\ref{main}. In contrast, the preconditioner
leads to shorter computation time by 
reducing the total number of iterations rather than making each
iterate calculation less costly.  In fact one PAMA iterate requires
more computation than an AMA iterate, but the difference is more than
offset by the reduction in total number of 
iterations, as is certainly the case in Figure~\ref{sqdconv}.
