This directory contains LaTeX files for the FastCap User's Guide
and related supplementary documents. Files with the `ug' prefix are 
have to do with the Guide, while the `tcad' and `mtt' prefixes 
identify files for reprints of a Trans. on CAD article and a 
Trans. on Microwave Theory and Tech. article respectively.  Poscript 
format figures are stored in the `figures' directory.

If you have trouble latexing the files in this directory, its probably
due to awk not being able to substitute the full path for this directory
for the dummy path in the files `ug.tex' `tcad.tex' and `mtt.tex' 
inside the definition of the macro `\topdir' --- if you run into
this problem, edit these three files by hand and put in whatever pwd
produces in this directory for the definition of the `\topdir' macro
in each file.  Then comment out all but the last line in the targets `ug.dvi'
`tcad.dvi' and `mtt.dvi' in `Makefile' in this directory.  Now cd
to .. and `make manual' should work.

See ../README for instructions on how to produce the associated .dvi files.
No .dvi files are provided in the release -- they must be produced by the user.
