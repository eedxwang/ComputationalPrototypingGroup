\noindent In \cite{nabors91}, a boundary-element based
algorithm was presented for computing the capacitance of
three-dimensional $m$-conductor structures whose computational
complexity grows nearly as $mn$, where $ n $ is the number of elements
used to discretize the conductor surfaces.  In that algorithm, a
generalized conjugate residual iterative technique is used to solve
the $n\times n$ linear system arising from the discretization, and a
multipole algorithm is used to compute the iterates.  In this paper,
several improvements to that algorithm are described which make the
approach in \cite{nabors91} applicable and computationally efficient for
almost any geometry of conductors in a homogeneous dielectric.  In
particular, a new adaptive multipole algorithm is described, along
with a strategy for accelerating the iterative algorithm by exploiting
electrostatic screening.  Results using these techniques in a program
which computes the capacitance of general three-dimensional structures
are presented to demonstrate that the new algorithm is nearly as
accurate as the more standard direct factorization approach, and is
more than two orders of magnitude faster for large examples.
